[Sync.Today](/index.html) is both the proven application integration server and sychronization engine. 
When used as the standalone server, it can synchronize common business entities like calendar events between Exchange and Google. It integrates very well to existing CRM and ERP applications.

The plan for 2016 is to make [Sync.Today 2016](/index.html) much more usable by developers too. 
It will allow external developers to remove the boilerplate code to connect to common services like Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Office 365, Google Apps or specialized applications like Microsoft Project Server, Todoist and others.

The roots of Sync.Today lays in several synchronization engines created from 2004. Sync.Today became a commercial product in 2012 and is used by users worldwide in corporations like RWE, T-Mobile, Gumex or InterActive.
